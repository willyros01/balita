/* ============================================================
   sw.js — makes the app work without a signal.

   Two rules:
     The app itself   cache first, so it opens instantly.
     The stories      network first, falling back to the last
                      copy that was fetched.

   Bump VERSION whenever you change any file in SHELL. That is
   what makes phones pick up a new build.

/* Written out rather than imported.

   This read the version from another file, which meant that if that
   file failed to load for any reason the worker threw on install —
   and a worker that fails to install leaves the previous one in
   charge, serving the old app indefinitely. A fix could then be
   uploaded and have no effect at all, with nothing to show why.
   Keep it in step with version.js by hand; the cost of forgetting is
   one stale cache, not a permanently frozen app. */

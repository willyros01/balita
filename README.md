# Wire

News from anywhere, stripped of advertising and set for easy reading.

A small web app that installs to a phone, tablet or computer home screen.
No account, no password. Text size, high contrast and day/night are always
one tap away, never buried in a menu.

## Version

**0.5.0**

- **Renamed from Balita to Wire.** The app reads BBC, CBC and CNN as
  readily as Inquirer, and the old name said otherwise. Settings saved
  under the old name are carried across automatically.
- **A real icon.** The story card reduced to its bones: the spine bar that
  runs beside every headline, and the lines of text next to it.
  Monochrome, so it looks right in either mode.
- **Stories that arrive incomplete now say so.** A blocked story explains
  that the outlet refuses the fetcher, and offers a large button to the
  original — with a plain warning that their site carries advertising. The
  list flags them too, so you know before tapping.
- **Unreachable outlets cost seconds, not minutes.** Feed discovery was
  retrying each of eight guessed addresses three times over. Last run spent
  380 of its 391 seconds on two outlets that were never going to answer.
- **The log tells the truth.** A counting mistake printed NaN and hid two
  sources entirely. It also now distinguishes a timeout from an outright
  refusal, which want different responses.
- **CNN switched on.** It shipped disabled by mistake, which is why it
  never appeared in any run.


## What each file does

| File | What it is for |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The page shell |
| `manifest.webmanifest` | Lets it install to the home screen |
| `sw.js` | Offline caching and updates |
| `tokens.css` | Every colour and size, all three modes |
| `app.css` | Layout and components |
| `config.js` | **The only file you edit** — keys and feed list |
| `store.js` | Firestore, with device-only fallback |
| `display.js` | Text size, contrast, day and night |

| `app.js` | Wiring — loads everything, holds the shared state |
| `feed.js` | The story list and the source chips |
| `reader.js` | One story, decluttered |
| `sources.js` | Adding and removing feeds |
| `articles.json` | The stories. Written by the fetcher |
| `sources.json` | The feed list. Read by both the app and the fetcher |

The fetcher — runs on GitHub, never in the browser:

| File | What it is for |
|---|---|
| `fetch-feeds.mjs` | The run: read feeds, decide what is new, write the file |
| `extract.mjs` | Strips a news page down to blocks of text and pictures |
| `discover.mjs` | Finds a feed address from a home page |
| `net.mjs` | Outbound requests: timeouts, retries, and a polite gap |
| `package.json` | The three libraries the fetcher needs |
| `.github/workflows/feeds.yml` | The schedule |

## How the fetcher works

Every half hour, on GitHub's machines:

1. Read `sources.json`.
2. Fetch each feed. If an address turns out to be a home page rather than a
   feed, look for the feed and use that instead.
3. Compare against the `articles.json` already committed. Stories already
   there are left alone — a normal run opens a handful of pages, not
   hundreds.
4. For genuinely new stories: if the feed carried the full text, use it. If
   not, open the article page and run it through Readability, the same
   engine behind Firefox's Reader View.
5. Keep only paragraphs, headings, quotes, lists and the story's own
   pictures. Everything else is discarded.
6. Write `articles.json` and commit it.

Nothing from a news site is ever passed through as HTML. Each block is
plain text or a picture address, so no script or tracker can reach the
phone.

Run it yourself with `npm install` then `npm run fetch`.

## Setting it up

See `SETUP.md`. In short: create a repo named `balita`, upload every file,
then turn on Pages under Settings.

Firebase is optional. Without it the app keeps your sources and settings on
the device it is running on. With it, they follow you between devices.

## Licence

Yours. Do as you like with it.
